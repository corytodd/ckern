OS Dev Bare Bones Kernel

This is the result of following the OS Dev bare bones OS development guide. I am running Virtual Box on a Windows
10 host running a Debian 8 32-bit VM. See the debian_os_dev.txt file for notes on setup.

No major issues were encountered in this process. Now that the cross-compiler is built and I have Geany and makefile,
compilation and qemu testing is super easy.

For now, this is just for learning and fun.
